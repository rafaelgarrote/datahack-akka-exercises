/**
  * Exercise 1 - "Echoes in the night"
  *
  * In this exercise we will learn how to create our first Akka Actor,
  * the "EchoActor", the purpose of this Actor is to echo back incoming messages
  * to whomever sent the message. If there is way to reply, it should do nothing.
  *
  * We will learn how to create Actors, start them, receive messages and reply with a response.
  * On top of that we will learn how to write unit tests using ScalaTest!
  *
  * Below is the blueprint of our soon to be EchoActor,
  * this is where you will implement the behavior of the actor.
  *
  * Underneath the EchoActor-class is the unit-test you will create
  * to verify your implementation.
  *
